# Q3DN3D_MAP
Duke Nukem 3d Hollywood Holocaust map for Quake 3 Arena

Keep in mind that I was a beginner at map creation and learned many things only near the end of the process, so the map is quite chaotic.

* This map was made to be played with the ExcessivePlus mod.
* The focus was on preserving the original look of the map by using the same textures.
* There is no lighting configuration in the map.
* There are no items in the map, except for the flags when playing CTF.
* Feel free to create your own branches.

File AllTextures.rar contains all the TGA textures used in DN3D game.
These textures has no transparency. I used Krita to change the color black to transparent.
After saving the TGA on Krita, you must convert it using XnConvert, otherwise the image wll be upsidown.

If you want to play DN3D on Windows 11 I recommend [HDuke](https://hduke.neocities.org/)
